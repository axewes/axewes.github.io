												Description
											</h3>
											<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">
												E-Guard Keylogger Detector combats keylogging software by monitoring all running applications, targeting those attempting to communicate 
												through popular SMTP ports for Gmail, Yahoo, ATT, Microsoft, and AOL for both Windows and Linux machines. This software will run 
												uninterrupted in the background while the device runs so that workflow can proceed as normal. Once the software has targeted an application
												that is communicating through specific SMTP ports, the process will be paused, and the user will be notified of the potential threat. 
												Then, the user will be asked if this process should be added to a trusted whitelist to continue running as normal or kill the process 
												immediately and be added to a blacklist so that any other time this process is running it will be automatically terminated.

											<h2>Virtual Labs</h2>
											<h3 style="text-align: left;">
												Description
											</h3>
											<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">
												The first task in this project consisted of completing and refining lab documents in Microsoft Word that focused on 
												various Cyber Security topics including data anonymization, virtual switches and bridges, network virtualization 
												using Open vSwitch and Linux Bridge, OpenFlow software, SDN controllers, Overlay Network protocols, Network 
												Intrusion Detection Systems, system and network vulnerabilities using Nmap, TCP/IP security, firewall 
												configurations, and basic concepts of VPNs.
												<br>
												After several weeks of completing and debugging these labs, I was partnered with another Research Assistant to 
												rebuild the lab documents using Sphinx-python documentation. This is a documentation generator which provides 
												the tools for compiling and generating HTML from reStructredText (markup language). Throughout the course of 
												several months, we fine-tuned the lab documents, converting them from .docx into reStructuredText manually and 
												through the use of bash scripting for streamlined conversions. This gave us the flexibility to turn the labs 
												into one cohesive format with the benefits of using a markup language to provide more user-friendly graphics 
												and syntax.
												<br>
												Finally, once our project had been completed and peer reviewed, myself along with my Research Assistant partner and several
												other members of our larger research team participated in a week-long workshop where professors from various universities across 
												the United States attended to be taught the material we had helped to develop. During this workshop, myself and the other
												members of my research team acted as Teaching Assistants who helped one on one with the participants to ensure the material
												was understood and to help with any clarification needed for the labs that followed the lecture.

											</h3>
											<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">
												The materials in this project were originally developed by Catalyzing Computing and Cybersecurity in 
												Community Colleges (C5) project and contained PowerPoint presentations with corresponding lab documents
												that instructs beginner programmers how to write secure code and robust Python code.
												<br>
												This project was created originally using Python 2 and specifically for Linux. I, along with two other Research Assistants
												were tasked with updating the PowerPoints, lab documents, and solutions to Python 3 as well as creating both
												Linux and Windows friendly versions.
												<br>
												Once our task was completed and our work had been peer reviewed, our updated project was presented to a group of students,
												with no prior coding experience, attending a university in California for a week long workshop to get a peek inside the world of coding
												and cyber security. Myself and the two other Research Assistants participated as Teaching Assistants in this event, helping
												students one on one and as a group to ensure if somebody was behind and needed help or a further explanation of the lecture.

								Technology has always been something that’s both fascinated and terrified me since I was young, like how I learned not trust everything 
								that can be downloaded on the internet. My favorite video game growing up was RuneScape where I could adventure online with my friends 
								running around an open world, exploring, training my skills, killing dragons, and even other players. The problem was, I wasn’t very good, 
								and I didn't have the patience to earn gold myself to become a better player. As a naive kid looking for an easy way out, I quickly found 
								internet tools that promised to make my character rich beyond my wildest dreams with one click. How lucky, I thought, I was to be one of 
								the only people to know about this! Without question, I downloaded it and after entering my username and password into this magical application, 
								I sat and waited as I began to write down all the ways I wanted to spend my gold. Unfortunately, the gold never came as I was soon kicked offline, 
								had my items stolen, and was left with a sinking feeling in my stomach thinking how I was so easily manipulated.
								<br><br>
								As I grew into adulthood, my passion for technology grew and I was eventually hired with a cable company as an installation and repair 
								technician where I trained growing my skills in a professional environment. I started at the bottom, no prior work experience, only this passion 
								I've held onto since I was young. It soon became abundantly clear I would need to put in more effort than I ever had before, as the competition 
								was tough, and the success rate was low. Not only was the material challenging, but I also struggled to learn how to carry the equipment, 
								in particular a 32-foot extension ladder. Admittedly, I’m not the strongest nor tallest guy in the world, so using brute force wasn’t an option. 
								Instead, I had to master the proper technique, failing many times along the way, even being told by my training supervisors I should reconsider 
								if this is something I want to pursue. I pushed myself beyond what I thought I was capable of and graduated top of the class, earning some of the 
								highest scores for performance. Eventually, after more time and dedication to perfecting my work, I was promoted to lead technician and was 
								responsible for training new hires for 90 days. I was the person my team members relied on for help or advise, and that was an amazing feeling. 
								After a few years of hard work, I found myself at the top of my current position, unable to progress further without a higher education.  
								For me, school had never been something I prioritized, or put much effort into. Looking back, I saw my perseverance in all of the times I was 
								told I couldn’t do something. Not only was I able accomplish my goals but became one of the best at and taught others my methods. I realized what 
								I’m capable of, and since then I’ve began at UTC in Summer 2019. I’ve consistently been awarded a Dean’s List participant each semester, an 
								achievement I’ve never held in my academic life. What I study is my true passion, and I realize now more than ever my full potential and what 
								I can accomplish when I put my mind to it.

								I’m a huge nature enthusiast and spend a good amount of my free time exploring new trails or going to the park with my wife and dog. 
								Chattanooga is an amazing city for this kind of lifestyle where we are able to explore nearly endless amounts of hiking trails filled with 
								beautiful scenery right next to downtown where we find great spots to eat or drink with friends and family.
								<br><br>
								When the weather doesn’t permit us to be out for long, or at all, I keep myself entertained inside by reading books on technology or space 
								innovation, Chasing New Horizons as of lately which describes in stunning detail the New Horizon satellite that launched mid-2015 to 
								explore Pluto and the Kepler belt. I also enjoy playing open-world video games such as RuneScape still as well as more recent titles such
								as Red Dead Redemption 2.
